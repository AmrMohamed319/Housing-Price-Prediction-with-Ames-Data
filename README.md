# Housing-Price-Prediction-with-Ames-Data
This project aims to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset through a series of data analysis and machine learning techniques. The final model achieved a top 1% rank on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and skewed data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Modeling:** Training and evaluating various regression models.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, transforming skewed features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as total square footage and quality score, and transformed features using logarithmic scaling.
- **Modeling:** Trained multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation:** The final model was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and achieved a top 1% rank on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Installation
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
